This module provides functions for plotting. 

* ``PlotUtilities.py`` loads plot settings, also saves the results as ``SVG`` format.
* ``DisplayUtilities.py`` detects whether the running environment is a Jupyter notebook, interactive python or none. This is required to determine whether the display should be enabled (for interactive plots) or disabled (for saving plots).
